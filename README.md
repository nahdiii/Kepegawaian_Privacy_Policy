## 1) Data We Collect

We collect only the data needed to operate core features (attendance, location verification, and HR administration) and to improve security and service quality.

**a) Account & Profile Data**

* Employee name, employee ID/NIK, unit/department, internal UID/username.
* Profile photo/URL (if provided).

**b) Location Data**

* Precise location (GPS coordinates) **at the time you perform attendance** (latitude and longitude).
* Mock‑location status for fraud prevention.

**c) Device & SIM Data (when permission is granted)**

* Device identifiers (e.g., Android ID or other permitted identifiers).
* Limited SIM/telecom information such as country phone prefix and carrier name; phone number **only** if you grant the relevant permission.
* Technical information: device model, OS version, IP address, connectivity/log data.

**d) Usage & Event Data**

* Attendance history (timestamps, selected campus), QR code scan results, feature interactions, and error logs for diagnostics.

> The App may use third‑party map/tiles and location services. Technical data required to render maps or resolve location may be processed by those providers under their own privacy policies.

## 2) Purposes of Processing

We process data to:

* **Provide attendance and location verification** in line with institutional policies.
* **Enhance security and prevent fraud** (e.g., detect mock location or unauthorized devices).
* **Operate and support** the App (maintenance, bug fixes, performance improvements).
* **Generate reports and perform HR administration** (attendance summaries, internal audit).
* **Comply with legal obligations** where applicable.

**Legal bases** may include performance of a contract/assignment, our legitimate interests, your consent for specific permissions (e.g., location, phone state), and compliance with applicable laws.

## 3) Sharing of Data

We **do not sell** your personal data. We may share data with:

## 4) Storage & Retention

* Data is stored on infrastructure we operate or on that of trusted service providers.
* Attendance and operational records are retained **only as long as necessary** for administration, auditing, and compliance, in line with internal retention policies.
* When no longer needed, data is deleted or anonymized securely.

## 5) Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard data (e.g., HTTPS in transit, access controls, and data minimization). However, **no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure**, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6) Your Choices & Rights

Subject to internal policy and applicable law, you may request to:

* Access and/or obtain a copy of your personal data.
* Correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
* Delete certain data, or restrict/obiect to processing in specific situations.
* Withdraw consent for specific device permissions (e.g., location, camera, phone state) via device settings. Note: core features (attendance) may not function without these permissions.

Requests can be made via the contact details in **Section 10**.

## 7) Device Permissions Used

Depending on the features you use, the App may request the following permissions:

* **Location (Precise/High Accuracy)** – to verify attendance at the workplace.
